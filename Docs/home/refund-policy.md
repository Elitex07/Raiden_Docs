# Refund Policy

### Raiden Premium

We want you to be happy with your purchase. If you are not satisfied with the premium, you can appeal for a Refund and cancel further services. We offer a **pro rata** refund policy for our premium subscription plans. This means that you can cancel your subscription at any time and receive a refund for the unused portion of your plan.

For example, if you bought a premium plan for $12 that will expire after 28 days, and you file a return after 7 days of usage, you will receive a refund of $9.

In order to initiate a refund, you will need to provide Invoice/Txn ID and reason for refund. The refund will be issued to the payment method used for purchase.&#x20;

### Custom Services

If you are not satisfied with the service, you can appeal for a Refund and cancel further services. You can appeal for a refund within 3 days of **delivery** or when the service was **started**. We will not issue a refund after 3 days of delivery, instead if the appeal is made within 7 days, you can appeal for desired modifications in the product (from which you were not satisfied).

For example, if you bought a service for $15 that will renew/expire after 28 days, and you file a return within 3 days of delivery, you will receive a full refund of $15. If you file a return after 3 days but within 7 days, you will not get a refund, but instead you can appeal for modifications in the product.

In order to initiate a refund, you will need to provide Invoice/Txn ID and reason for refund. The refund will be issued to the payment method used for purchase.&#x20;

Please note that refunds are issued to the original payment method only. We reserve the right to deny refunds if we detect any fraudulent or abusive behavior. Return requests on certain orders may not be available (you will be informed prior about it).
