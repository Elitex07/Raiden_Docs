# What is Raiden Bot?

### Introduction

Raiden is a Discord Utilities Bot, which is designed to help server owners to manage their discord server, with each possible feature. Unlike any other bot, Raiden is having its own unique User Interface (UI). User Interface of Raiden allows you to go through all the options in a module without making you to run multiple commands at once.

### History

Raiden was created on 21 November 2021 with a vision to be private bot for our small discord server. At first Raiden only had some basic commands and features. With the span of time, Raiden is developed to support much more functionality. From the very starting of the development, we have always focused on to make the bot as light we can make it. Who like bulky Application in 2020's ?

Eventually some of the server members started demanding that, Raiden should be a public bot and should be made accessible to all Discord Server. We took some time and on around 14 December 2021, we declared bot as a public bot. With time, number of servers increased, and we applied for Discord Verification on 21 January 2022.

Discord Verified Raiden on 6 March 2022. Pretty late ðŸ¥²

### Current Raiden

From day it's made Raiden has seen many updates in its history. The time when we are writing this, Raiden has been shifted from its old Model to a new Model, which is insanely powerful than previous one. We are still aimed to add more features to the bot.
